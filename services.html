                High pressure cleaning and washing is normally done by high
                pressure water jet pump to remove dirt, mud, oil, grease, paint,
                debris, scale etc... High pressure reciprocating plunger / piston
                pump develops high pressure due to smaller diameter orifice of the
                nozzle, which develops high pressure whivh in thru converts in to
                high velocity causing water jet blasting on the object. Apropriate
                flow rate and pressure can easily clean the job. PressureJet
                offeres high pressure pumps up to 2800 bar having maximum power up
                to 500 hp. Howaver, for cleaning and washing applications we have
                displayed products up to 500 bar and 60 hp only.

                Power plants burning anything other than natural gas will, over
                time, build up ash that forms slag deposits on the exterior of the
                tubes running through the boiler. The slag can be a safety hazard
                - the tubes expand and contract as they heat up and cool down and
                the deposits may break off and fall, a problem that arises most
                notably when a plant is taken off line for maintenance. Dirty
                boiler tubes can also affect the operation of a plant. Slag
                buildup on tubes will act as an insulation protecting the tube
                from the heat of the boiler, requiring more fuel to reach the same
                temperature and produce the same output as a clean boiler.
                cleaning the slag deposits inside a boiler can increase boiler
                efficiency from 1 percent to 4 percent. "Even 2 to 3 percent in a
                boiler that generates 600 MW, that's hundreds of thousands of
                dollars each day or week,They're still burning the coal, but the
                coal fire doesn't get to the tube." Clean boilers can also help
                reduce the emissions produced by the plant because less fuel is
                needed to produce the same amount of power

                Turbine blasting is a specialized blasting procedure. The work is
                done in the confinement of a tent equipped with a vacuum system,
                providing a dust free environment. This system protects the
                surrounding area and equipment from any contamination. It also
                allows work to continue in adjacent areas. We blast in a fully
                contained environment. Removing scale and deposits from the
                turbine components by means of grid lasting, prepares the unit for
                non-destructive testing purposes and allows the turbine to return
                to optimum efficiency. Our on-site services are performed on the
                turbine deck, eliminating the expense of shipping the components
                off-site or to the manufacturer, providing savings to our
                customers. Burt Cummings created and is the originator of the
                contained blast cleaning procedures that are still being used
                today by power plants and turbine maintenance companies because
                his design allows for the most efficient blast cleaning process.
